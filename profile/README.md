# MECM - Experimental, Computational, and Materials Mechanics Group

**MECM** is an interinstitutional research group focusing on **Experimental**, **Computational**, and **Materials Mechanics**. Founded in 2011, MECM is composed of around 30 members, including professors, researchers, students, and technicians.

## Leadership
The group is led by:
- Prof. [**Rodrigo B. Canto**](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9286-9912) (DEMa-UFSCar)
- Prof. [**Vinicius Fiocco Sciuti**](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3709-3189) (DEMa-UFSCar)
- Prof. [**Ricardo Afonso Ang√©lico**](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1621-9221) (EESC-USP)

## Research Focus
Our goal is to conduct advanced research and human resource development in **Mechanical** and **Materials Engineering**, closely aligned with industrial needs and technological innovation.

Key research areas include:
- **Computational modeling** of (thermo)mechanical behavior of materials
- **Simulation** of manufacturing processes
- **Conventional and non-conventional** experimental methods

### Tools & Techniques
We utilize a variety of computational and experimental tools, including:
- **Finite Element Method (FEM)**
- **Digital Image Correlation (DIC)**

## Collaboration & Impact
MECM operates in partnership with industry and academic institutions to promote **technological innovation** and contribute to the **scientific community**.
